# Circuit-Solver
solves resistor-voltage source-current source circuits for EECS 16A at UC Berkeley.


NOTE:
This circuit solver is pretty horribly implemented, as I didn't have a concrete method of solving it when I went in.
As I worked on the project, I pretty much dealt with everything on-the-go.
In addition, I implemented classes in the beginning in order to deal with organization -- this was not helpful, as I had to initialize a class using many variables

So, there may be many errors. Use at your own risk.
